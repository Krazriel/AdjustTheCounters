# Adjusting the Counters Solver with A* Algorithm

- Project for CS205 - Artificial Intelligence 
- This program uses three different search algorithms to solve a simple puzzle of Adjusting the Counters where the objective is to take a randomly shuffled N x N board of randomly placed unique counters from 1 to N^2 and continuosly swap places 1 counter for another until the board is in order from 1 to N^2, left to right, top to bottom. The search algorithms used are: Uniformed Cost Search, A* w/ Misplaced Tile Heuristics, and A* w/ Manhattan Distance Heuristics.
